# IDE Survival Guide

## Shortcuts

`Shift, Shift`  
Opens the "everything" menu. Start typing the name of something you are looking
for to find it quickly.

Type `Shift, Shift` again to automatically check the "Include non-project items"
option. This is a good way to look up annotations

`Ctrl + P`  
Not sure what a method or annotation expects you to provide? Put your cursor
between the parenthesis and use this shortcut to see argument lists.

`Alt + Insert`  
Open a menu for generating code. For example, getters, setters, equals, and
hashCode can all be automatically created from here.

`Alt + Enter`  
Show recommended actions. Useful on red squiggly code. Can also be used to import static methods from classes, which can help make code less verbose.
